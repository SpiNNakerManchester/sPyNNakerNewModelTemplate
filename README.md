# sPyNNaker New Model Template

This is a template repository for people wishing to build a new PyNN model to run within [sPyNNaker](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/sPyNNaker). To use it, fork this repository and edit your fork to add in your own code, or `git clone` the repository outright and work on it afresh. There are example source files (in both Python and C, depending on location and purpose) in all the locations where you can plug your code in; feel free to add or modify.
